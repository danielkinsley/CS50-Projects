        LTC (ASIC mined)
    </h1>
    <p>Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency created from a fork in the Bitcoin blockchain in 2011. It was initially designed to address the developer's concerns that Bitcoin was becoming too
        centrally controlled, and to make it more difficult for largescale mining firms to gain the upper hand in mining. While eventually unsuccessful in preventing enterprise miners from taking over the lion's share of Litecoin mining, the
        cryptocurrency has reworked itself into a minable coin and a peer-to-peer payment system.</p>
        <ul>Litecoin is a cryptocurrency founded in 2011, two years after Bitcoin, by a former Google engineer named Charlie Lee.
            It shares similar features with Bitcoin but has a different algorithm. The cryptocurrency's goal is to become a medium for daily transactions.
            Litecoin has a faster transaction processing time compared to Bitcoin.</ul>
